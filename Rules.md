## King of the Hill (Rules)  ##
a tactical board game by Florian Jehn

### 1. Game material ###
- a board with a center piece and four rings that become decreasingly smaller. Each ring has seven tiles 
- Two runner, five warriors and two blocker per player
- Four six-sided dice per player
- 28 tiles with different terrain: 12 light, eight normal, eight difficult
- Four starting areas (numbered from one to four)


### 2. Game setup ###
Every tile gets a randomly assigned terrain, such that every ring has three light, two normal and two difficult terrain. Every player gets his dice and units. Each player draws a random starting area. The player who got the starting area numbered four is allowed to place this starting area alongside any tile of the outer ring. Player three to one to the same, but two players are not allowed to place their starting area alongside the same tile of the outer ring. 

### 3. Game flow ###
This game is for two (better three) to four players. Every player has the same amount of units and dice. At the beginning of a round each player rolls his dice. The player with the starting area one begins. Every player is allowed to use two dice at a time. Using two dice is seen as one turn and two turns as one round. If a player can't use one or both dice during his turn than those dice are forfeited and can't be used in this round, with the following exceptions:
- If one has recruited all his units recruitment dice can be used as movement dice
- If one has no unit in the game movement dice can be used as recruitment dice
- A player is allowed to use three or four dice in his turn if this occurred because two or four turning dice where transformed to one respectively two movement dice. If the player does not have dice for his second turn because of this, the second turn is forfeited

### 4. Goal of the game ###
To win the game a player needs to place on of his units for 30 not consecutive turns on the center piece. Every turn is counted on which the unit is on the center piece at the end of the turn, including the one the unit reached the center piece. Won points can't be lost. Every player counts his own points. If a player forgets to count his points, the points are lost. 

### 5. Units ###
#### General ####
In the starting area unlimited units can be placed. In the outer ring only 5 units of one player are allowed. With each ring more inward one unit less per player is allowed at one tiles, thus the center piece allows only one unit per player. If a unit dies it is returned to the players hand. 
#### Runners ####
A runner can access all terrain types , and move up to three tiles. He can't attack and has one hitpoint. He can only be recruited after round three has ended. Runners can't move on or over tiles with fighters or blockers. 
#### Fighters ####
A fighter can access light and normal terrain. He can attack and has one hitpoint. Fighters are only allowed to move to a tile with a blocker on it if a second fighter come to the same tile in the same turn to fight the blocker (see fighting rules). 
#### Blockers ####
Blocker can access light terrain. He can't attack and has two hitpoints. Blocker can't move to a tile with a enemy fighter. If they move to a tile with an enemy runner, pushed away (see pushing rules). 

### 6. Possible actions ###
#### General ####
If no moves are possible, the dice are forfeited. One does not have to use all dice. Dice eye assignment:

- one and two: Recruitment
- three and four: Move and fight
- five and six: Turning


#### Recruitment ####
A recruitment dice can be used to recruit one unit in ones starting area. 

#### Move and fight ####
You can move every unit according to their type and fight with it if it is a fighter or push runners down if it is a blocker. 
##### Moving #####
You are only allowed to move left, right, up or down. Diagonal moves are not allowed. The number of tiles moved depends on the unit (see units)
##### Fighting #####
A fight automatically starts if a fighter moves into a tile with enemy units. Fights follow this rules:

- Fighter vs. fighter: Both die
- Fighter vs. runners: All runners die
- Fighter vs. blocker: One of the fighters and the blocker die

If there are different types of enemy units in a tile a fighter moves to the following rules apply:

- First the blockers need to be destroyed. If this is not possible the fighter cannot move to this tile
- Are there no blockers, the fighters fight each other
- Runners are only attacked if there a no other units to attack

Two players can help each other to destroy the blocker of a third player. This is only possible if two players have a least each one fighter on a tile next to a blocker of a third player. The player whose currently making his turn can offer the other player to attack the blocker of the third player. If the other player agrees, the active player must use on of his dice to attack and the blocker dies. To decide which fighter dies a dice is cast. If the dice eye shows one to three the fighter of the active player dies. If the dice eye shows four to six the fighter of the other player dies. The surviving fighter must move to the tile where the blocker was.   

##### Pushing #####
If a blocker pushes away a runner, the runner is moved one ring outwards to an adjacent tile. If it is pushed on the most outward ring, the runner is pushed to the field where the blocker started its move. 

#### Turning
With a turning dice three moves are possible:

- One ring can be turned one tile left or right
- the starting area with all units on it can be moved adjanced to another tile of the most outward ring, if there isn't another starting area
- The terrain of two neighbouring tiles (left, right, up, down) can be swapped, but only if no unit gets into a terrain is isn't meant to be

Two turning dice can be used as an move and fight dice

### 7. Alternate play styles ###
#### Counting down ####
For every turn a unit stands at the center piece one is subtracted from a counter (starting with 50). Once the counter reaches zero, the player with a unit in the center piece wins. If there is no unit in the center piece when the counter reaches zero, the next player who gets a unit to the center piece wins

#### One excluded ####
Players choose one unit that they are not allowed to use for the rest of the game, resulting in a less mirroring game-play. 

#### Teamplay ####
The player team up in two teams. The points made count for the team and not for the one player who scored it.
